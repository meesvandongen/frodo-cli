## Quick start

1. Download the platform specific binary archive from the [release page](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-cli/releases) and unzip it to a directory.
2. Open a terminal and change to the above directory. Create $PATH for frodo in `.bash` or `.zshrc` if you haven't already.

   **NOTE: MacOS and Windows may not let you run `frodo` right after you download (and unzip) and execute it for the very first time. Please refer to [this page](../docs/BINARIES.md) if this happens.**

3. Run `frodo conn add` (example below) to setup `frodo` for your ForgeRock environment. If all parameters are correct, `frodo` creates a new [connection profile](#connection-profiles). If you are offline and don't want to validate the data you enter, you can use the --no-validate paramter and frodo stores the [connection profile](#connection-profiles) without validating it.

   ```console
   $ frodo conn add https://openam-tenant-name.forgeblocks.com/am john.doe@company.com '5uP3r-53cr3t!'
   ForgeRock Identity Cloud detected.
   Connected to ForgeRock Access Management 7.2.0-2022-6-SNAPSHOT Build ee394dde039e790642653a516d498c16759876c1 (2022-July-07 19:49)
   Saving creds in /Users/john.doe/.frodo/.frodorc...
   ```

4. Test your connection profile using a simple convenience feature in frodo:

   ```console
   $ frodo info tenant-name
   Printing versions and tokens...
   ForgeRock Identity Cloud detected.
   Connected to ForgeRock Access Management 7.2.0-2022-6-SNAPSHOT Build ee394dde039e790642653a516d498c16759876c1 (2022-July-07 19:49)
   Cookie name: 6ac6499e9da2071
   Session token: g9CMhj7k9Asq...
   Bearer token: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV...
   ```

   Note how the command does not specify the complete tenant URL nor username nor password. I only uses a unique substring that matches the tenant URL and frodo looks up and uses the right [connection profile](#connection-profiles).

5. Now you can use other frodo commands, like `journey`, `logs`, `applications` etc. as desired. **For detailed usage, refer to [this](#usage)**

## Installing

### User Mode

Individuals who do not intend to develop or contribute to frodo should use this method. Please refer to [Quick Start](#quick-start)

### Developer Mode

For those who want to contribute or are just curious about the build process.

- Make sure you have Node.js v14 or newer installed.
- Clone this repo
  ```console
  git clone https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-cli.git
  ```
- Install via NPM
  ```console
  cd frodo-cli
  npm install
  npm i -g
  ```

### NPM package

If you are a node developer and want to use frodo as a cli tool or as a library for your own applications, you can install the npm package:

- To install (or update to) the latest version as a cli tool:
  ```console
  npm i -g @rockcarver/frodo-cli
  ```
- To install (or update to) the latest version as a dependency for you own application:
  ```console
  npm i --save @rockcarver/frodo-cli
  ```
- To install (or update to) the latest pre-release:
  ```console
  npm i @rockcarver/frodo-cli@next
  ```

## Usage

You can invoke `frodo` from the terminal as long as you're in the directory or sourced/added it to the path.

To get started, refer to [Quick Start](#quick-start).

### Connection Profiles

A connection profile is a set of ForgeRock environment URL (Access Management base URL), admin username and admin password. It can optionally contain log API key and secret for a ForgeRock Identity Cloud environment. All connection profiless are stored in `~/.frodo/.frodorc`. Passwords are stored encrypted. `.frodorc` can house information for multiple connections.

Use the `frodo conn` sub-commands to manage connections:

- `frodo conn list` to list all the connections frodo currently knows about for the current machine and user.
- `frodo conn add` to add a new connection profile.
- `frodo conn describe` to see all the details of a connection profile.
- `frodo conn delete` to remove a connection profile.

Once `frodo` saves a connection, you don't have to provide the `host`, `username`, and `password` arguments. You can reference your connection using any unique substring from your host. This is the most common way users would run frodo. For example, if `https://openam-example-use1-dev.id.forgerock.io/am` and `https://openam-example-use1-staging.id.forgerock.io/am` are two saved ForgeRock connections from previous commands, one would simply use:

```console
frodo info example-use1-dev
```

OR

```console
frodo info example-use1-staging
```
