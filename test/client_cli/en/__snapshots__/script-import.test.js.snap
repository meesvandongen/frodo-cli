Options:
  -m, --type <type>         Override auto-detected deployment type. Valid
                            values for type:
                            classic:  A classic Access Management-only
                            deployment with custom layout and configuration.
                            cloud:    A ForgeRock Identity Cloud environment.
                            forgeops: A ForgeOps CDK or CDM deployment.
                            The detected or provided deployment type controls
                            certain behavior like obtaining an Identity
                            Management admin token or not and whether to
                            export/import referenced email templates or how to
                            walk through the tenant admin login flow of
                            Identity Cloud and handle MFA (choices: "classic",
                            "cloud", "forgeops")
  -k, --insecure            Allow insecure connections when using SSL/TLS. Has
                            no effect when using a network proxy for https
                            (HTTPS_PROXY=http://<host>:<port>), in that case
                            the proxy must provide this capability. (default:
                            Don't allow insecure connections)
  --verbose                 Verbose output during command execution. If
                            specified, may or may not produce additional
                            output.
  --debug                   Debug output during command execution. If
                            specified, may or may not produce additional output
                            helpful for troubleshooting.
  --curlirize               Output all network calls in curl format.
  -f, --file <file>         Name of the file to import.
  -n, --script-name <name>  Name of the script. If specified, -a and -A are
                            ignored.
  --re-uuid                 Re-UUID. Create a new UUID for the script upon
                            import. Use this to duplicate a script or create a
                            new version of the same script. Note that you must
                            also choose a new name using -n/--script-name to
                            avoid import errors. (default: false)
  -s, --script <script>     DEPRECATED! Use -n/--script-name instead. Name of
                            the script.
  -h, --help                Help
