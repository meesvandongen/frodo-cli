"Usage: frodo conn save|add [options] [host] [username] [password] [key] [secret]

Save connection profiles.

Arguments:
  host                                         Access Management base URL, e.g.: https://cdk.iam.example.com/am. To use a connection profile, just specify a unique substring.
  username                                     Username to login with. Must be an admin user with appropriate rights to manage authentication journeys/trees.
  password                                     Password.
  key                                          API key for logging API.
  secret                                       API secret for logging API.

Options:
  --authentication-header-overrides [headers]  Map of headers: {"host":"am.example.com:8081"}.
  --authentication-service [service]           Name of the authentication service/tree to use.
  --curlirize                                  Output all network calls in curl format.
  --debug                                      Debug output during command execution. If specified, may or may not produce additional output helpful for troubleshooting.

  -k, --insecure                               Allow insecure connections when using SSL/TLS. Has no effect when using a network proxy for https (HTTPS_PROXY=http://<host>:<port>), in that case the proxy must provide this capability. (default: Don't allow insecure connections)
  -m, --type <type>                            Override auto-detected deployment type. Valid values for type: 
  classic:  A classic Access Management-only deployment with custom layout and configuration. 
  cloud:    A ForgeRock Identity Cloud environment. 
  forgeops: A ForgeOps CDK or CDM deployment. 
  The detected or provided deployment type controls certain behavior like obtaining an Identity Management admin token or not and whether to export/import referenced email templates or how to walk through the tenant admin login flow of Identity Cloud and handle MFA (choices: "classic", "cloud", "forgeops")
  --no-sa                                      Do not add service account.
  --no-validate                                Do not validate connection.
  --sa-id <sa-id>                              Service account id.
  --sa-id <uuid>                               Service account's uuid. If specified, must also include --sa-jwk-file. Ignored with --no-sa.
  --sa-jwk-file <file>                         File containing the JSON Web Key (JWK) associated with the the service account.
  --sa-jwk-file <file>                         File containing the service account's java web key (jwk). Jwk must contain private key! If specified, must also include --sa-id. Ignored with --no-sa.
  --verbose                                    Verbose output during command execution. If specified, may or may not produce additional output.
